    <p id="food-desc">Yum! We will be providing food and drinks for the weekend along with catering the night of the ceremony. Breakfast and dinners will be family affairs while lunches and snacks are at your leisure. We will do our best to accommodate all food squirrels (aka dietary needs) but if there are certain things you can’t live without, we empower you to grab it yourself. Be mindful there is limited refrigeration space but we will have an ample number of coolers.</p>
